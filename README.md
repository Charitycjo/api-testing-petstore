# API and UI Automation Testing Project

This project demonstrates my ability to design and execute both **UI and API test automation** using industry-standard tools.

## Project Highlights
- Built a **Cypress automation script** to test the login flow of a sample e-commerce website.
- Designed **API edge case tests** (invalid credentials, special characters, long inputs) against the Swagger Petstore API using **Postman**.
- Implemented **Postman test scripts** to validate status codes, response times, and error handling.
- Documented **test results** and **edge case scenarios** in Markdown for professional reporting.
- Published a complete project repository on GitHub, including:
  -  Postman Collection (`.json`)
  -  API Test Results (`API_Test_Results.md`)
  -  Edge Case List (`Edge_Case_List.md`)

##  Skills Demonstrated
- End-to-end **automation testing** (UI + API)
- Writing and executing **edge case tests**
- Using **Postman** for API validation
- Using **Cypress** for UI automation
- Clear documentation in **Markdown**
- Version control with **GitHub**

## Value
This project reflects my ability to:
- Identify meaningful **edge cases** that uncover system weaknesses.
- Use automation to improve **efficiency and consistency** in testing.
- Communicate technical results in a way that recruiters, managers, and developers can understand.
